## Getting Started
This repository holds most of the code of the ZEL.ZIP project, its development workflow is based on the use of [Nix flake devShells](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell#nix_develop) and a custom build terminal toolkit called `dev`.

This CLI tool allows for the most common development actions
```sh
# Enable the Nix flake devShell
$ nix develop

# The command then becomes available
$ dev --help

# With it you can do multiple actions like:
# Checking if the code will pass the CI/CD checks
dev check

# Try to fix some code issues
dev fix

# Check missing TODO tasks
dev todo
```

## TODO comments format
TODO comments use a simple format that tries to convey a little more info about the issue at a first glance: `TODO(<KIND>): <MESSAGE>`, where `<KIND>` can be:
- `IMPROVE`: This code can be improved.
- `CLEANUP`: This code, without adding new features, can be made easier to understand.
- `IMPLEMENT`: Here is missing a new feature.
- `DISCOVER`: Related to reverse engineering, the following code interacts with some system or format not fully understood yet.
- `TRACK(<URL>)`: This issue depends on a fix by a third-party, the `<URL>` points to the relevant status about the development of the fix, usually being a code issue in GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, etc.

## `dirty/` directories
Any directory called `dirty/` will be ignore by lints and Git, feel free as a developer to add any required file for early testing.

## Ignore-like file generation
Ignore-like files (`.gitignore`, `.prettierignore`, etc) are builded by merging all the `.ignore` files inside the `//ignores` reposity, to regenerate these files run:
```sh
$ dev ignores
```
