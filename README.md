## Getting Started

This repository holds most of the code of the ZEL.ZIP project, its development workflow is based on the use of [Nix flake devShells](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell#nix_develop) and a custom build terminal toolkit called `dev`.

Enter the devShell:

```sh
$ nix develop
```

Setup the monorepo:

```sh
$ dev setup
```

If you are going to work with a WASM library (`icebrk-wasm`, etc) remember to compile and build the NPM packages first:

```sh
$ dev wasm
```

This CLI tool allows for the most common development actions:

```sh
# Checking if the code will pass the CI/CD checks
dev check

# Try to fix some code issues
dev fix

# Check missing TODO tasks
dev todo
```

## TODO comments format

TODO comments use a simple format that tries to convey a little more info about the issue at a first glance: `TODO(<KIND>): <MESSAGE>`, where `<KIND>` can be:

- `IMPROVE`: This code can be improved.
- `CLEANUP`: This code, without adding new features, can be made easier to understand.
- `IMPLEMENT`: Here is missing a new feature.
- `DISCOVER`: Related to reverse engineering, the following code interacts with some system or format not fully understood yet.
- `TRACK: <URL>`: This issue depends on a fix by a third-party, the `<URL>` points to the relevant status about the development of the fix, usually being a code issue in GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, etc.

## `dirty/` directories

Any directory called `dirty/` will be ignore by lints and Git, feel free to add any required file for early testing.

## Ignore-like file generation

Ignore-like files (`.gitignore` and folks) are builded by merging all the `.ignore` files inside the `//ignores` directory, to regenerate these files run:

```sh
$ dev ignores
```
